A has committed murder.\n(8) When an offence is committed by means of several acts, whoever intentionally\ncooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either\nsingly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence.\nIllustration\n(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses\nof poison. A and B administer the poison according to the agreement with intent to\nmurder Z. Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to\nhim. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as\neach of them does an act by which the death is caused, they are both guilty of the\noffence though their acts are separate.\n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively\nfor six hours at a time. A and B, intending to cause Z's death, knowingly cooperate\nin causing that effect by illegally omitting, each during the time of his attendance, to\nfurnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B\nare guilty of the murder of Z.\n(c) A, a jailor, has the charge of Z, a prisoner. A, intending to cause Z's death,\nillegally omits to supply Z with food; in consequence of which Z is much\nreduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death.\nA is dismissed from his office, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or\ncooperation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is\nlikely thereby to cause Z's death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as\nA did not cooperate with B. A is guilty only of an attempt to commit murder.\n(9) Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal\nact, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act.\nIllustration\nA attacks Z under such circumstances of grave provocation that his killing of Z would\nbe only culpable homicide not amounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and\nintending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in\nkilling Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z's death, B is guilty of\nmurder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide."

ACT LIKELY TO CAUSE HARM, BUT DONE WITHOUT CRIMINAL\nINTENT, AND TO PREVENT OTHER HARM.\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is\nlikely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in\ngood faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.\nExplanation.--It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented\nor avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of\ndoing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.\nIllustrations\n(a) A, the captain of a [steam] vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence\non his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must\ninevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he\nchanges the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk\nof running down a boat C with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly\nclear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in\ngood faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he\nis not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which\nhe knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger\nwhich he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running\ndown the boat C.\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from\nspreading. He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or\nproperty. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so\nimminent as to excuse A's act, A is not guilty of the offence.\n\nTHE BHARATIYA NYAYA SANHITA, 2023"

B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit\nmurder.\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers\nfrom the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder.\nExplanation 3.--It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable\nby law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or\nknowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.\nIllustrations\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a person of unsound mind [lunatic] 101\nto commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law\nof committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the\nact be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age,\nto do an act which causes Z's death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in\nthe absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable by\nlaw of committing an offence, Ais liable to be punished in the same manner as if\nB had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder,\nand he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of his unsoundness\nof mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is\nwrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's instigation. B\nhas committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a\ndwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence.\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging\nto Z out of Z's possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes\nthe property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's property.\nB, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not\ncommit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as\nif B had committed theft.\nExplanation 4.--The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an\nabetment is also an offence.\nIllustration\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C\ncommits that offence in consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his\noffence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence,\nA is also liable to the same punishment.\nExplanation 5.--It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by\nconspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits\nit. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is\ncommitted.\n101 The term 'lunatic' has been replaced with 'person of unsound mind'.\nIllustration\nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z.

C agrees to\nprocure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being\nused in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence.\nHere, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the\nconspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered.

Z dies in consequence. A commits\nmurder.\n(b)\nA, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to\ncause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies\nin consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not\nhave been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a\nperson in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring\nunder any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary\ncourse of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he\nmay intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend\nto cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would\ncause death.\n(c)\nA intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of\na man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here A is guilty\nof murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death.\n(d)\nA without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one\nof them. Ais guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated\ndesign to kill any particular individual.\nException 1.-- [when culpable homicide is not murder-] Culpable homicide is not\nmurder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and\nsudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or\ncauses the death of any other person by mistake or accident: [the above exception is\nsubject to the following provisos: ]\nProvided that the provocation is not,-\n(a)\n[First- That the provocation is not] sought or voluntarily provoked by the\noffender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person;\n(b)\n[Secondly - That the provocation is not] given by anything done in obedience to\nthe law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public\nservant;\n(c)\n[Thirdly - That the provocation is not] given by anything done in the lawful\nexercise of the right of private defence.\nExplanation.--Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent\nthe offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.\nIllustrations\n(a)\nA, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z,\nintentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was\nnot given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or\nmisfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.\n(b)\nY gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol\nat Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near\nhim, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely\nculpable homicide.\n(c)\nA is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by\nthe arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given\nby a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.\n(d)\nA appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a\nword of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden\npassion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.\n(e)\nA attempts to pull Z's nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence,\nlays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent\npassion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the\nprovocation was [given] giving by a thing done in the exercise of the right of\nprivate defence.\n(f)\nZ strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander,\nintending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a\nknife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have\ncommitted only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.\nException 2.--Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good\nfaith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to\nhim by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right\nof defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than\nis necessary for the purpose of such defence.\nIllustration\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A\ndraws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he can by\nno other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not\ncommitted murder, but only culpable homicide.\nException 3.--Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant\nor aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the\npowers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith,\nbelieves to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public\nservant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.\nException 4.--Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without\npremeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and\nwithout the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual\nmanner.\nExplanation.--It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or\ncommits the first assault.\nException 5.--Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is\ncaused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death\nwith his own consent.\nIllustration\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a child (person under eighteen years of age) to\ncommit suicide.

A unfastens the moorings, and thus\nintentionally causes the boat to drift down the stream. Here A intentionally\ncauses motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner\nthat the motion is produced without any other action on any person's part. A\nhas therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's\nconsent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it\nto be likely that this use of force will cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has\nused criminal force to Z.\n(b)\nZ is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z's horses, and thereby causes them to quicken\ntheir pace. Here A has caused change of motion to Z by inducing the animals\nto change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this\nwithout Z's consent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby\ninjure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z.\n(c)\nZ is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the\npalanquin. Here A has caused cessation of motion to Z, and he has done this by\nhis own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus\nintentionally, without Z's consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A\nhas used criminal force to Z.\n194 Section 350, IPC,\n(d)\nA intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily\npower moved his own person so as to bring it into contact with Z. He has\ntherefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z's consent,\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or\nannoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.\n(e)\nA throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be\nthus brought into contact with Z, or with Z's clothes, or with something carried\nby Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z's clothes or\nsomething carried by Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect\nof causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z's clothes, A has\nused force to Z, and if he did so without Z's consent, intending thereby to injure,\nfrighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z.\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a woman's veil. Here A intentionally uses force to her, and\nif he does so without her consent intending or knowing it to be likely that he\nmay thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her.\n(g)\nZ is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here\nA intentionally by his own bodily power causes such motion in the boiling\nwater as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated\nthat such contact must affect Z's sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally\nused force to Z; and if he has done this without Z's consent intending or\nknowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z,\nA has used criminal force.\n(h)\nA incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z's consent.

THEFT\n\n(1) Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the\npossession of any person without that person's consent, moves that property in order to\nsuch taking, is said to commit theft.\nExplanation 1.--A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable\nproperty, is not the subject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft\nas soon as it is severed from the earth.\nExplanation 2.--A moving effected by the same act which affects the severance may\nbe a theft.\nExplanation 3.--A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an\nobstacle which prevented it from moving or by separating it from any other thing, as\nwell as by actually moving it.\nExplanation 4.--A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said\nto move that animal, and to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so\ncaused, is moved by that animal.\nExplanation 5.--The consent mentioned in this section (definition) may be express or\nimplied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having\nfor that purpose authority either express or implied.\nIllustrations\n(a)\nA cuts down a tree on Z's ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the\ntree out of Z's possession without Z's consent. Here, as soon as A has severed the\ntree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.\n(b)\nA puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here,\nif A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's\nconsent. A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A.\n(c)\nA meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain\ndirection, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the\nbullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.\n(d)\nA being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly\nruns away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft.\n(e)\nZ, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z\nshall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was\nnot in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and\nA has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of\ntrust.\n(f)\nA finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the\nring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.\n(g)\nA finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by\ntaking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation\nof property.\n(h)\nA sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to\nmisappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides\nthe ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z,\nwith the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when\nthe loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits\ntheft.\n(i)\nA delivers his watch to Z, a jeweler, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A,\nnot owing to the jeweler any debt for which the jeweler might lawfully detain\nthe watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of\nZ's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal\ntrespass and assault, has not committed theft, in as much as what he did was not\ndone dishonestly.\n(j)\nIf A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully\nas a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the\nintention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits\ntheft, in as much as he takes it dishonestly.\n(k)\nAgain, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without\nZ's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft,\nthough the watch is his own property in as much as he takes it dishonestly.\n(l)\nA takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession without Z's consent, with\nthe intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for\nits restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.\n(m)\nA, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and\ntakes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of\nreading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A\nmay have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was\nA's impression, A has not committed theft.\n(n)\nA asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A\nknows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that Amay conceive that\nZ's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not\ncommitted theft.\n(o)\nA is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows\nto belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no (not)\nauthority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits\ntheft.\n(p)\nA, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes\nthat property out of Z's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does\nnot commit theft.\n(2)\n[Punishment for theft] Whoever commits theft shall be punished with\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years,\nor with fine, or with both and in case of second or subsequent conviction of any\nperson under this section, he shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for\na term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to five years\nand with fine:\nProvided that in cases of theft where the value of the stolen property is less than five\nthousand rupees, and a person is convicted for the first time, shall upon return of\nthe value of property or restoration of the stolen property, shall be punished with\ncommunity service.\nSection 303 'Theft' of BNS corresponds to Section 378 and Section 379 of IPC.\n\nThe offence of theft has been provided much needed nuance considering that\ntheft can have either opportunistic origins or it can result from careful\nplanning, coordination, and sophistication.\n\nHarsher punishment has been prescribed for repeat offenders of theft - a\nmandatory minimum sentence of 1 year extendable to 5 years with fine.\n\nTo prevent theft from becoming a gateway crime, first-time offenders are\npunished only with community service, where the value of the stolen property\nis less than Rs. 5000 and either such value is returned or such property is\nrestored.\n\nProviso to sub-section (2) of Section 303 provides the punishment of theft\nfor first time offenders"

Here Ahas committed theft, and, in order to the\ncommitting of that theft, has voluntarily caused wrongful restraint to Z. A\nhas therefore committed robbery.\n(b)\nA meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z's purse. Z,\nin consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z by\nputting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the\nextortion in his presence. A has therefore committed robbery.\n(c)\nA meets Z and Z's child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to\nfling it down a precipice, unless Z delivers his purse. Z, in consequence,\ndelivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in\nfear of instant hurt to the child who is there present. A has therefore committed\nrobbery on Z.\n(d)\nA obtains property from Z by saying--\"Your child is in the hands of my gang,\nand will be put to death unless you send us ten thousand rupees\". This is\nextortion, and punishable as such; but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of\nthe instant death of his child.\n(4)\n[Punishment for robbery] Whoever commits robbery shall be punished with\nrigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall\nalso be liable to fine; and, if the robbery be committed on the highway between\nsunset and sunrise, the imprisonment may be extended to fourteen years.\n(5)\n[Attempt to commit robbery] Whoever attempts to commit robbery shall be\npunished with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven\nyears, and shall also be liable to fine.\n(6)\n[Voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery] If any person, in committing\nor in attempting to commit robbery, voluntarily causes hurt, such person, and\nany other person jointly concerned in committing or attempting to commit\nsuch robbery, shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with rigorous\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable\nto fine.416"

MAKING A FALSE DOCUMENT.\nA person is said to make a false document or false electronic record--\n(A)[First] Who dishonestly or fraudulently--\n(i) [a] makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document;\n(ii) [b] makes or transmits any electronic record or part of any electronic record;\n(iii) [c] affixes any electronic signature on any electronic record;\n(iv) [d] makes any mark denoting the execution of a document or the authenticity of\nthe electronic signature,\nwith the intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of document,\nelectronic record or electronic signature was made, signed, sealed, executed, transmitted\nor affixed by or by the authority of a person by whom or by whose authority he knows\nthat it was not made, signed, sealed, executed or affixed; or\n(B) [Secondly] Who without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by\ncancellation or otherwise, alters a document or an electronic record in any material\npart thereof, after it has been made, executed or affixed with electronic signature either\nby himself or by any other person, whether such person be living or dead at the time\nof such alteration; or\n(C) [Thirdly] Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute\nor alter a document or an electronic record or to affix his electronic signature on any\nelectronic record knowing that such person by reason of unsoundness of mind or\nintoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception practised upon him, he does not\nknow the contents of the document or electronic record or the nature of the alteration.\nIllustrations\n(a)\nA has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to\ndefraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum 1,00,000 intending\nthat it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.\n(b)\nA, without Z's authority, affixes Z's seal to a document purporting to be a\nconveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling the estate to B\nand thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery.\n485 Chapter XVIII of BNS corresponds to Chapter XVIII of IPC. It extends from Sections 335 to Section\nof BNS.\n(c)\nA picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any\nsum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently fills up the cheque by\ninserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery.\n(d)\nA leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting\nthe sum payable and authorises B to fill up the cheque by inserting a\nsum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain\npayments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting the sum of twenty\nthousand rupees. B commits forgery.\n(e)\nA draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B's authority,\nintending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and intending to take\nup the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the\nbanker by leading him to suppose that he had the security of B, and thereby to\ndiscount the bill, A is guilty of forgery.\n(f)\nZ's will contains these words--\"I direct that all my remaining property be\nequally divided between A, B and C\". A dishonestly scratches out B's name,\nintending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A\nhas committed forgery.\n(g)\nA endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his\norder by writing on the bill the words \"Pay to Z or his order\" and signing the\nendorsement. B dishonestly erases the words \"Pay to Z or his order\", and thereby\nconverts the special endorsement into a blank endorsement. B commits forgery.\n(h)\nA sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate,\nexecutes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated six months earlier\nthan the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had\nconveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. A has committed forgery.\n(i)\nZ dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from\nthe legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the\nwill according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed\nforgery.\n(j)\nA writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that\nA is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen\nmisfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other\npersons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with\nproperty, A has committed forgery.\n(k)\nA without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's\ncharacter, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed\nforgery in as much as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and\nthereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service.\nExplanation 1.--A man's signature of his own name may amount to forgery.\nIllustrations\n(a)\nA signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed\nthat the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed\nforgery.\n(b)\nA writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in\norder that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B\nupon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty\nof forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to\nA's intention, B is also guilty of forgery.\n(c)\nA picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of\nthe same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be\nbelieved that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable;\nhere A has committed forgery.\n(d)\nA purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the\nseizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate, to Z at\na nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior\nto the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the\nlease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own\nname, commits forgery by antedating it.\n(e)\nA, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit,\nand with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the\ntransaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value\nreceived, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been\nmade before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under\nthe first head of the definition.\nExplanation 2.--The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person,\nintending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the\nname of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by\nthe person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.\nIllustration\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill\nin the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.\nExplanation 3.--For the purposes of this section, the expression \"affixing electronic\nsignature\" shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section\n2 of the Information Technology Act, 2000."
