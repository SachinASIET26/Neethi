It is proved\nthat he was in possession of a particular stolen article. The fact that, at the same\ntime, he was in possession of many other stolen articles is relevant, as tending\nto show that he knew each and all of the articles of which he was in possession\nto be stolen.\n(b)\nA is accused of fraudulently delivering to another person a counterfeit currency\n(coin) which, at the time when he delivered it, he knew to be counterfeit. The\nfact that, at the time of its delivery, A was possessed of a number of other pieces\nof counterfeit currency (coin) is relevant. The fact that A had been previously\nconvicted of delivering to another person as genuine a counterfeit currency\n(coin) knowing it to be counterfeit is relevant.\n(c)\nA sues B for damage done by a dog of B's, which B knew to be ferocious. The\nfact that the dog had previously bitten X, Y and Z, and that they had made\ncomplaints to B, are relevant.\n(d)\nThe question is, whether A, the acceptor of a bill of exchange, knew that the\nname of the payee was fictitious. The fact that A had accepted other bills drawn\nin the same manner before they could have been transmitted to him by the\npayee if the payee had been a real person, is relevant, as showing that A knew\nthat the payee was a fictitious person.\n(e)\nA is accused of defaming B by publishing an imputation intended to harm the\nreputation of B. The fact of previous publications by A respecting B, showing\nill-will on the part of A towards B is relevant, as proving A's intention to harm\nB's reputation by the particular publication in question. The facts that there\nwas no previous quarrel between A and B, and that A repeated the matter\ncomplained of as he heard it, are relevant, as showing that A did not intend to\nharm the reputation of B.\n(f)\nA is sued by B for fraudulently representing to B that C was solvent, whereby\nB, being induced to trust C, who was insolvent, suffered loss. The fact that, at\nthe time when A represented C to be solvent, C was supposed to be solvent by\nhis neighbours and by persons dealing with him, is relevant, as showing that A\nmade the representation in good faith.\n(g)\nA is sued by B for the price of work done by B, upon a house of which A is\nowner, by the order of C, a contractor. A's defence is that B's contract was with\nC. The fact that A paid C for the work in question is relevant, as proving that A\ndid, in good faith, make over to C the management of the work in question, so\nthat C was in a position to contract with B on C's own account, and not as agent\nfor A.\n(h)\nA is accused of the dishonest misappropriation of property which he had found,\nand the question is whether, when he appropriated it, he believed in good faith\nthat the real owner could not be found. The fact that public notice of the loss of\nthe property had been given in the place where A was, is relevant, as showing\nthat A did not in good faith believe that the real owner of the property could\nnot be found. The fact that A knew, or had reason to believe, that the notice was\ngiven fraudulently by C, who had heard of the loss of the property and wished\nto set up a false claim to it, is relevant, as showing that the fact that A knew of\nthe notice did not disprove A's good faith.\n(i)\nA is charged with shooting at B with intent to kill him. In order to show A's\nintent, the fact of A's having previously shot at B may be proved.\n(j)\nA is charged with sending threatening letters to B. Threatening letters previously\nsent by A to B may be proved, as showing the intention of the letters.\n(k)\nThe question is, whether A has been guilty of cruelty towards B, his wife.\nExpressions of their feeling towards each other shortly before or after the\nalleged cruelty are relevant facts.\n(l)\nThe question is, whether A's death was caused by poison. Statements made by A\nduring his illness as to his symptoms are relevant facts.\n(m)\nThe question is, what was the state of A's health at the time when an assurance\non his life was effected. Statements made by A as to the state of his health at or\nnear the time in question are relevant facts.\n(n)\nA sues B for negligence in providing him with a car (carriage) for hire not\nreasonably fit for use, whereby A was injured. The fact that B's attention\nwas drawn on other occasions to the defect of that particular car (carriage)\nis relevant. The fact that B was habitually negligent about the cars (carriage)\nwhich he let to hire is irrelevant.\n(o)\nA is tried for the murder of B by intentionally shooting him dead.

The fact that he said something\nindicating a general disposition to commit crimes of that class is irrelevant.\n\nSection 12 of BSA corresponds to Section 14 of IEA.\n•\nIn Illustration (b), the term 'coin' has been replaced with the term 'currency'.\n•\nIn Illustration (n), the word 'carriage' has been replaced with the word\n'car'."

PROOF OF ADMISSIONS AGAINST PERSONS MAKING THEM, AND BY\nOR ON THEIR BEHALF.\nAdmissions are relevant and may be proved as against the person who makes\nthem, or his representative in interest; but they cannot be proved by or on behalf of\nthe person who makes them or by his representative in interest, except in the following\ncases, namely:--\n(1)\nan admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when it is\nof such a nature that, if the person making it were dead, it would be relevant as\nbetween third persons under section 26 (32);\n(2)\nan admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, when it\nconsists of a statement of the existence of any state of mind or body, relevant\nor in issue, made at or about the time when such state of mind or body existed,\nand is accompanied by conduct rendering its falsehood improbable;\n(3)\nan admission may be proved by or on behalf of the person making it, if it is\nrelevant otherwise than as an admission.\nIllustrations\n(a)\nThe question between A and B is, whether a certain deed is or is not forged. A\naffirms that it is genuine, B that it is forged. A may prove a statement by B that\nthe deed is genuine, and B may prove a statement by A that deed is forged; but\nA cannot prove a statement by himself that the deed is genuine, nor can B prove\na statement by himself that the deed is forged.\n(b)\nA, the captain of a ship, is tried for casting her away. Evidence is given to show\nthat the ship was taken out of her proper course. A produces a book kept by\nhim in the ordinary course of his business showing observations alleged to have\nbeen taken by him from day to day, and indicating that the ship was not taken\nout of her proper course. A may prove these statements, because they would be\nadmissible between third parties, if he were dead, under clause (b) of section\n[section 32, clause (2)].\n(c)\nA is accused of a crime committed by him at Kolkata (Calcutta). He produces\na letter written by himself and dated at Chennai (Lahore) on that day, and\nbearing the Chennai (Lahore) post-mark of that day. The statement in the date\nof the letter is admissible, because, if A were dead, it would be admissible under\nclause (b) of section 26 [section 32, clause (2)].\n(d)\nA is accused of receiving stolen goods knowing them to be stolen. He offers\nto prove that he refused to sell them below their value. A may prove these\nstatements, though they are admissions, because they are explanatory of\nconduct influenced by facts in issue.\n(e)\nA is accused of fraudulently having in his possession counter feit currency\n(coin) which he knew to be counterfeit. He offers to prove that he asked a skillful\nperson to examine the currency (coin) as he doubted whether it was counterfeit\nor not, and that person did examine it and told him it was genuine. A may prove\nthese facts [for the reasons stated in the last preceeding illusatation].\n\nSection 19 of BSA corresponds to Section 21 of IEA.\n•\nIn Illustration (c), the names of places 'Calcutta' and 'Lahore' have been\ndeleted and replaced with 'Kolkata' and 'Chennai'.\n•\nIn Illustration (e) the term 'coin' has been replaced with the term 'currency'."

For example, a video is saved across multiple files to\nmanage its content. The computer, through automated process, may sequentially store\nparts of the record in separate files one after another or a computer using parallel\nprocessing or distributed storage systems can simultaneously store electronic records\nacross multiple files.\nExplanation 4 acknowledges the phenomena of an electronic record being stored in\nmultiple files and determines each such file as primary evidence. The words\n'storage occurs' and 'simultaneously or sequentially' denotes that this explanation\nlimits itself to automated processes of the computer only.\nExplanation 5. -- Where an electronic or digital record is produced from proper\ncustody, such electronic and digital record is primary evidence unless it is disputed.\nThis explanation emphasizes the importance of proper custody. Explanation to Section\n81 of BSA describes what is 'proper custody' as - 'electronic records are said to be in\nproper custody if they are in the place in which, and looked after by the person with\nwhom such document is required to be kept; but no custody is improper if it is proved\nto have had a legitimate origin, or the circumstances of the particular case are such\nas to render that origin probable.'\n•\n'Proper custody' ensures authenticity of electronic records. If an electronic\nrecord is not in proper custody, it is at the risk of being tampered, transposed,\naltered, or fabricated. Proper custody ensures that the data remains unchanged\nor uncorrupted, maintaining its original form and content. It also establishes a\nchain of custody of the electronic record, denoting who had access to the data\nand when.\n•\nProper custody becomes an important aspect to be considered to establish an\nelectronic record as primary evidence.\n•\nWherever proper custody is disputed, such electronic/digital record ceases to\nbe admissible as primary evidence.\nExplanation 6. -- Where a video recording is simultaneously stored in electronic form\nand transmitted or broadcast or transferred to another, each of the stored recordings\nis primary evidence.\n\nThis Explanation delineates the nature of an electronic record in a video when\nits stored and disseminated simultaneously in different forms.\n\nIt includes each such storage, occurring while a video is transferred, transmitted\nor broadcast to another device, as primary evidence.\n\nThis explanation essentially dilutes the principle of 'original electronic record'\nin context of a video recording. It is no more essential to produce the original\ndevice making the recording of a video to establish such electronic record as\nprimary evidence. All electronic record pertaining to the transfer, transmission\nor broadcast of that video will also be primary evidence of that video.\n\nIt is essential that such dissemination occurs simultaneously for it to qualify as\nprimary evidence.\nExplanation 7. -- Where an electronic or digital record is stored in multiple storage\nspaces in a computer resource, each such automated storage, including temporary\nfiles, is primary evidence."

It is\ncomplementary to Section 60 (b) read with Explanation (ii) to Section 60 of\nBSA, according to which written admission may be allowed by the court as\nsecondary evidence when the existence, condition or content of the original is\nadmitted in writing.\n•\nSection 58(viii) refers to a situation where a large number of documents need\nto be reviewed, but it is impractical to examine all of them in Court due to their\nvolume. It allows for an expert who specializes in analysing such documents to\nreview them and then provide evidence in Court based on their examination.\nThis enables Courts to get a clear and concise summary from someone skilled\nin understanding the documents, without having to go through every single\none of them.\n\nTHE BHARTIYA SAKSHYA ADHINIYAM, 2023"

Once the tenancy ended, the tenant could challenge the\nlandlord's title.\n\nBy extending the restriction to any time after the tenancy period, BSA provides\nstronger protection for the landlord. It ensures that the tenant or any person\nclaiming through the tenant cannot deny the landlord's title even after vacating\nthe property. This prevents potential disputes regarding the landlord's title from\narising post-tenancy.\n\nThis addition brings greater clarity and certainty in landlord-tenant\nrelationships.
