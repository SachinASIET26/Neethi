PROCEDURE FOR INVESTIGATION\n(1) If, from information received or otherwise, an officer in charge of a police station\nhas reason to suspect the commission of an offence which he is empowered under\nsection 175 [156] to investigate, he shall forthwith send a report of the same to a\nMagistrate empowered to take cognizance of such offence upon a police report and\nshall proceed in person, or shall depute one of his subordinate officers not being below\nsuch rank as the State Government may, by general or special order, prescribe in this\nbehalf, to proceed, to the spot, to investigate the facts and circumstances of the case,\nand, if necessary, to take measures for the discovery and arrest of the offender:\nProvided that--\n(a) when information as to the commission of any such offence is given against any\nperson by name and the case is not of a serious nature, the officer in charge of a\npolice station need not proceed in person or depute a subordinate officer to make an\ninvestigation on the spot;\n(b) if it appears to the officer in-charge of a police station that there is no sufficient\nground for entering on an investigation, he shall not investigate the case.\nProvided further that in relation to an offence of rape, the recording of statement of the\nvictim shall be conducted at the residence of the victim or in the place of her choice\nand as far as practicable by a woman police officer in the presence of her parents\nor guardian or near relatives or social worker of the locality and such statement may\nalso be recorded through any audio-video electronic means including mobile phone.\nSection 176 of BNSS corresponds to Section 157 of CrPC. The proviso to subsection (1) of Section 176 has been altered to mandate the police to record the victim's\nstatement using audio- visual means in case of a victim of rape.\n(2) In each of the cases mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of the first proviso to subsection (1), the officer in charge of the police station shall state in his report the\nreasons for not fully complying with the requirements of that sub-section by him, and,\nforward the daily diary report fortnightly to the Magistrate and in the case mentioned\nin clause (b) of the said proviso, the officer shall also forthwith notify to the informant,\nif any, in such manner as may be prescribed by rules made by the State Government\n[Provided by the State Government, the fact that he will not investigate the case or\ncause it to be investigated].\nIn sub-section (2) it has been mandated that the police officer in charge of the police\nstation must forward the daily dairy report to the Magistrate fortnightly. The\nphrase in the previous law that,'the officer shall also forthwith notify to the informant,\nif any, in such manner as may be prescribed by the State Government, the fact that he\nwill not investigate the case or cause it to be investigated' has been modified and Section\n193(3)(i) makes it compulsory for the station in charge of the police station to inform\nthe victim or the informant about the progress of the investigation within a period of\nninety days by any means including through electronic communication.\n(3) On receipt of every information relating to the commission of an offence which\nis made punishable for seven years or more, the officer in charge of a police station\nshall, from such date, as may be notified within a period of five years by the State\nGovernment in this regard, cause the forensic expert to visit the crime scene to collect\nforensic evidence in the offence and also cause videography of the process on mobile\nphone or any other electronic device:\nProvided that where forensic facility is not available in respect of any such offence, the\nState Government shall, until the facility in respect of that matter is developed or made\nin the State, notify the utilisation of such facility of any other State.\nSub-section (3) and a proviso to it have been added to Section 176 for bringing\ncredibility to investigation. Forensic experts have been mandated to visit the crime\nscene to collect forensic evidence for offences punishable for 7 years or more. The\nStates shall, as early as possible but not later than 5 years, make forensic evidence\ncollection in such cases compulsory. Also, where a forensic facility is not available\nfor the time being, it has been provided that the State Government may notify the use\nof such facility in another State."

reasons and in the interests of justice the continuation of the investigation\nbeyond the period of six months is necessary.\n(10) [6] Where any order stopping further investigation into an offence has been made\nunder sub- section (9), [sub-section (5)] the Sessions Judge may, if he is satisfied, on an\napplication made to him or otherwise, that further investigation into the offence ought\nto

There were many transactions between A and B, and A\nhad no means of knowing to which of them the charge referred and offered no\ndefense.

A was never charged with\nany murder but one, and had heard the inquiry before the Magistrate, which\nreferred exclusively to the case of Haidar Baksh. The Court may infer from these\nfacts that A was not misled, and that the error in the charge was immaterial.\n(e)\nA was charged with murdering Haidar Baksh on the 20th January, 2023, [1882]\nand Khoda Baksh (who tried to arrest him for that murder) on the 21st January,\n2023. [1882] When charged for the murder of Haidar Baksh, he was tried for the\nmurder of Khoda Baksh. The witnesses present in his defence were witnesses in\nthe case of Haidar Baksh.

This clarifies that the referral and subsequent care,\ntreatment, and prognosis of the accused by a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist must\ntake place within Government hospital or a Government medical college.\nSimilarly, Proviso (b) of Section 367(2), now provides that where an accused\nperson is dissatisfied with the information given by a psychiatric or clinical\npsychologist to a Magistrate, the accused person may prefer an appeal before the\nMedical Board which shall consist of a faculty member in psychiatry in the nearest\nGovernment medical college.\n(3)\n[2] Pending such examination and inquiry, the Magistrate may deal with\nsuch person in accordance with the provisions of section 369 [330].\n(4)\n[3] If the Magistrate is informed that the person referred to in sub-section (2)\n[1A] is a person of unsound mind, the Magistrate shall further determine\n391 Chapter XXVII extends from Section 367 to Section 378 of BNSS. It corresponds to Section 328 to\nSection 339 of Chapter XXV of CrPC. Marginal heading of the section has been changed from 'Procedure in case of accused\nbeing lunatic' to 'Procedure in case of accused being person of unsound mind'.\nwhether the unsoundness of mind renders the accused incapable of entering\ndefence and if the accused is found so incapable, the Magistrate shall record a\nfinding to that effect, and shall examine the record of evidence produced by\nthe prosecution and after hearing the advocate of the accused but without\nquestioning the accused, if he finds that no prima facie case is made out against\nthe accused, he shall, instead of postponing the enquiry, discharge the accused\nand deal with him in the manner provided under section 369 [330]:\n\nProvided that if the Magistrate finds that a prima facie case is made out against\nthe accused in respect of whom a finding of unsoundness of mind is arrived\nat, he shall postpone the proceeding for such period, as in the opinion of the\npsychiatrist or clinical psychologist, is required for the treatment of the accused,\nand order the accused to be dealt with as provided under section 369 [330].\n(5)\n[4] If [such] the Magistrate is informed that the person referred to in subsection (2) is a person with intellectual disability [mental retardation], the\nMagistrate shall further determine whether the intellectual disability\n[mental retardation] renders the accused incapable of entering defence, and\nif the accused is found so incapable, the Magistrate shall order closure of the\ninquiry and deal with the accused in the manner provided under section\n[330].\n368.

Under Section 368(4) the term 'mental retardation' has been replaced with the term\n'intellectual disability'.\nSection 368 of BNSS corresponds to Section 329 of CrPC.\nUnder Proviso (b) of Section 368(2) provides that where an accused person is dissatisfied\nwith the information given by a psychiatric or clinical psychologist to a Magistrate,\nthe accused person may prefer an appeal before the Medical Board which shall consist\nof head of psychiatry unit in the nearest Government hospital and a faculty member\nin psychiatry in the nearest Government medical college.\n(3)\n[2] If the Magistrate or Court is informed that the person referred to in\nsub-section (2) [1A] is a person of unsound mind, the Magistrate or Court\nshall further determine whether the unsoundness of mind renders the accused\nincapable of entering defence and if the accused is found so incapable, the\nMagistrate or Court shall record a finding to that effect and shall examine the\nrecord of evidence produced by the prosecution and after hearing the advocate\nof the accused but without questioning the accused, if the Magistrate or Court\nfinds that no prima facie case is made out against the accused, he or it shall,\ninstead of postponing the trial, discharge the accused and deal with him in the\nmanner provided under section 369 [330]:\n\nProvided that if the Magistrate or Court finds that a prima facie case is made\nout against the accused in respect of whom a finding of unsoundness of mind\nis arrived at, he shall postponethe trial for such period, as in the opinion of\nthe psychiatrist or clinical psychologist, is required for the treatment of the\naccused.\n(4)\n[3] If the Magistrate or Court finds that a prima facie case is made out against\nthe accused and he is incapable of entering defence by reason of intellectual\ndisability [mental retardation], he or it shall not hold the trial and order the\naccused to be dealt with in accordance with section 369 [330]."

WARRANT FOR LEVY OF FINE\n(1) When an offender has been sentenced to pay a fine, but no such payment has been\nmade, the Court passing the sentence may take action for the recovery of the fine in\neither or both of the following ways, that is to say, it may--\n(a) issue a warrant for the levy of the amount by attachment and sale of any movable\nproperty belonging to the offender;\n(b) issue a warrant to the Collector of the district, authorising him to realise the\namount as arrears of land revenue from the movable or immovable property, or both,\nof the defaulter:\nProvided that, if the sentence directs that in default of payment of the fine, the\noffender shall be imprisoned, and if such offender has undergone the whole of such\nimprisonment in default, no Court shall issue such warrant unless, for special\nreasons to be recorded in writing, it considers it necessary so to do, or unless it has\nmade an order for the payment of expenses or compensation out of the fine under\nsection 395 [357].\n(2) The State Government may make rules regulating the manner in which warrants\nunder clause (a) of sub-section (1) are to be executed, and for the summary\ndetermination of any claims made by any person other than the offender in respect\nof any property attached in execution of such warrant.\n(3) Where the Court issues a warrant to the Collector under clause (b) of sub-section\n(1), the Collector shall realise the amount in accordance with the law relating to recovery\nof arrears of land revenue, as if such warrant were a certificate issued under such law:\nProvided that no such warrant shall be executed by the arrest or detention in\nprison of the offender.\nSection 461 of BNSS corresponds to Section 421 of CrPC.\n\nThe phrase 'but no such payment has been made' has been added to sub-section\n(1) of Section 461. It specifies that the Court can only take recovery actions if\nthe offender fails to pay the fine. This ensures that measures like attaching\nand selling property or authorizing the Collector to collect as arrears of land\nrevenue are only initiated when the fine remains unpaid, thus preventing\npremature enforcement actions.\n\nTHE BHARATIYA NAGARIK SURAKSHA SANHITA, 2023"

This proviso clarifies that\nthe need for the accused to be identified by witnesses during the investigation or for\npolice custody beyond the initial 15 days cannot be the sole reason to deny bail if the\naccused is otherwise eligible and agrees to follow the court's directions.\n(2) If it appears to such officer or Court at any stage of the investigation, inquiry or\ntrial, as the case may be, that there are not reasonable grounds for believing that the\naccused has committed a non-bailable offence, but that there are sufficient grounds for\nfurther inquiry into his guilt, the accused shall, subject to the provisions of section\n[446A] and pending such inquiry, be released on bail, or, at the discretion of such officer\nor Court, on the execution by him of a bond [without sureties] for his appearance as\nhereinafter provided.\n(3) When a person accused or suspected of the commission of an offence punishable\nwith imprisonment which may extend to seven years or more or of an offence under\nChapter VI, Chapter VII or Chapter XVII of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, or abetment of, or conspiracy or attempt to commit,\nany such offence, is released on bail under sub-section (1), the Court shall impose the\nconditions,--\n(a) that such person shall attend in accordance with the conditions of the bond executed\nunder this Chapter;\n(b) that such person shall not commit an offence similar to the offence of which he is\naccused, or suspected, of the commission of which he is suspected; and\n(c) that such person shall not directly or indirectly make any inducement, threat or\npromise to any person acquainted with the facts of the case so as to dissuade him from\ndisclosing such facts to the Court or to any police officer or tamper with the evidence,\nand may also impose, in the interests of justice, such other conditions as it considers\nnecessary.\n(4) An officer or a Court releasing any person on bail under sub-section (1) or subsection (2), shall record in writing his or its reasons or special reasons for so doing.\n(5) Any Court which has released a person on bail under sub-section (1) or subsection (2), may, if it considers it necessary so to do, direct that such person be arrested\nand commit him to custody.\n(6) If, in any case triable by a Magistrate, the trial of a person accused of any\nnonbailable offence is not concluded within a period of sixty days from the first\ndate fixed for taking evidence in the case, such person shall, if he is in custody during\nthe whole of the said period, be released on bail to the satisfaction of the Magistrate,\nunless for reasons to be recorded in writing, the Magistrate otherwise directs.\n(7) If, at any time, after the conclusion of the trial of a person accused of a non-bailable\noffence and before judgment is delivered, the Court is of opinion that there are\nreasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of any such offence, it\nshall release the accused, if he is in custody, on the execution by him of a bond [without\nsureties] for his appearance to hear judgment delivered."
