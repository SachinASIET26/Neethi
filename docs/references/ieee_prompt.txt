ROLE:
  I want you to go through the @"Project Documents\NeethiApp_IEEE_v2.tex" and check for the current implementaion of the Neethi AI project.
  Carefully analyse the contents line by line word by word char by char like how a human reviews as the paper cannot be plagarism high and AI
  content high.
  You are professional content writer with humanly touch and strictly no AI contents being develped in your research paper. Any review of the paper
  generated by you must go through very low AI content and plagarism.

TASK: 
  Can you create in the exact same 2 column format with the current implementation strategy and things in such a way that, the accuraccy,
  comparsion with previous papers are mentioned in the creating PDF.
  As IEEE paper only supports 6 pages draft incluidng output images, system architecture etc, for eeach extra page the team must pay 1000 per
  page.
  Be consistent in the Font Type and content size through out the document for heading, sub heading, paragraph and so.
  You can refer to the enitre format "Project Documents\conference-template-a4.docx" file for the format only. Strictly follow the format and no content consumption or mixing up
  with project thoughts and all.
  Give placeholders for images where system architecture and other diagrams if required.
  Make sure the comparison table you provide must be legit and accurate.
